# docker-helloworld
docler cli hello world cli plugin example

main.go comes from https://github.com/docker/cli - in cli-plugins/examples

and then there's a bunch of poking to get a go.mod that lets it build.

now I'm reading https://github.com/docker/cli/issues/1534 - as having the `docker-helloworld` binary in ~/.docker/cli-plugins/ isn't enough
